In the [previous posts][previous_post] we have talked about research, challenges, ideas and user testing. This blog post is about the final concept within the framework for this project.

## Final concept
The final concept is a ninja game based on research about how to learn the keyboard in a pedagogical way and ideas from the team and users.

We hope that a game is a more fun way to learn how to type on a keyboard and will motivate the user to learn. The value for the user is to in a fun way to become more independent on the keyboard and be able to use it for daily tasks in school and later in life at work.

Since the last prototype, we have made some improvements to the prototype. At the start page, we have added some ninja characters, colors, logotype and styling to be a more cohesive product and to match the theme. In general in visual design, the content is centered which is important for the users with a zoom tool. We want the important visual information to be as big and centered as possible in this product.

We have also added a game plan to the concept that match the pedagogical way to learn the keyboard. With 4 different levels in the game with 15 challenges in total. To present the name of the level and what is supposed to be taught on the levels:

<ul>
  <li>Level 1 red belt: explore</li>
  <li>Level 2 orange belt: placement of the fingers.</li>
  <li>Level 3 green belt: words and sentences.</li>
  <li>Level 4 black belt: speed.</li>
</ul>

![Levels, print screen.][image2]{:class="img-fluid w-100 rounded float-left mr-5 mb-4"}

In these levels there are 15 different challenges the user can do. They have to do them in chronological order to be able to play the game starting at the first challenge and ending with the last that gives the user a black belt in keyboard typing.

We added new characters to the game to make it more in line with age of the users and with the ninja theme, they are named Doruk and Fousari.

![Challenge 3, print screen.][image7]{:class="img-fluid w-100 rounded float-left mr-5 mb-4"}

The character you choose will follow you in the challenges and get a visual representation of the belts you collect which will also be read by the text to speech. We also have the letter you are supposed to write in the same place as it’s indicating if you are right or wrong after feedback from a user with a zoom tool to keep the visual content centered.

These are the biggest changes in the prototype and concept this far. We will test this prototype with more children with a visual impairment to be able to know what can be improved.

## Things we didn't have time to do
In this project we had several ideas and thoughts that we wanted to do but because the limited time and resources in the project and that the goal was to create a prototype we didn’t have time to do these things:

<ul>
  <li>Create an account to save results</li>
  <li>Multiplayer game </li>
  <li>Multi-language </li>
  <li>Mobile/iPad and Bluetooth keyboard to mobile support</li>
  <li>Support for Internet Explorer</li>
  <li>Our own recorded sound instead of text to speech to make it a better user experience</li>
</ul>

## User testing
To be continued… the prototype will be tested with 10 children with a visual impairment.

## Steps forward
The steps moving forward is to create more challenges in the concept and to elaborate on the existing ones. We will also do more user testing to get more feedback on what can be improved in the existing solution.

Our other vision is to spread the project to the open-source community to get contributions to this important project that helps children with a visual impairment to learn how to type on a keyboard.

## Contributions
First of all, we want to say a huge thank you to the people whom we got to interview and do user testing with during this project, which gave us insights and ideas for the concept.

Also thanks to free service [textamig.se](https://www.textamig.se/) that generated quick subtitles to our movie.

We also want to give thanks and attributions to the free resources we have used in this project that helped our work and the results.
