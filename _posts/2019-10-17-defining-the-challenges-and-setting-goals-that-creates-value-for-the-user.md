In the previous post we shared the research that has been done in the beginning of the project, länk. In this post we’ll talk more about what the main problems are to learn how to type on a keyboard and what questions we’ll ask to try to solve these identified challenges for the users in our primary target group of children with a visual impairment between the age 7-14.

## Independence
Children and youths that has a visual impairment dependent on the help center (syncentralen) to get the technical support to learn how to type on a keyboard. The ones that exist also cost money and therefore are dependent on the government help to finance it. The technical choices may therefore be different to the needs of the children and different from their peers. Sometimes they are out to date and uninspiring, when learning progress faster when it’s fun. There is no product today that is modern, fun, has enough sound feedback and accessible for the swedish keyboard layout and for people with different abilities.

## Motivation
Learning to type on a keyboard for children with a visual impairment can be a bit of resistance because of the initial interaction with the keyboard focus on right or wrong. This is perceived as boring and needs a lot of support and motivation from people around. Learning without realising that is the goal, step by step with short exercise is the key to success.

Focus for this project should therefore be to get the children excited by interacting with the keyboard on a beginner level, because that where the main problems occur today. The more expert users don’t need the same support for learning the keyboard.

## Questions to work with
* How can we create a product that enables more independence in the learning process of keyboard training without dependence on technical and and help center resources?
* How can we create an inspiring product that motivates the user to learn the keyboard while having fun?
* How can we make the first interaction with the keyboard intriguing instead of a feeling of resistance?

## Goal
The goal with this project is to create a prototype and concept that is a first step to make something that can be developed further. We hope our insights and user centered work can inspire others to continue working with this important tool that help children with visual impairments type on a keyboard. That is why the project is open source, free and anyone can contribute to the project. We will also share all the work and knowledge and insights we identify within this project.

Our goal is to build an inspiring, fun and educational typing tutor tool to help children interact and learn the keyboard while having a joyful experience.

## Value
With this free open source solution that will be available online where you can learn the keyboard in a new fun and challenging way without having to use the eye sight as a primary sense.

* We hope that the value for the user will be to learn more independently without dependence on other resources (technical or economical).
* We also hope that this solution will inspire to learn in a fun and creative way to keep the users motivated to learn the keyboard which is an essential tool for everyone in today's society both at school, work and in private as a navigation and communication tool in the digital world.
* We also strive to make a solution that everyone can use and not a special solution for people with a visual impairment. We hope this will create a value for the user to feel included and able to use the same learning tool as their peers.
