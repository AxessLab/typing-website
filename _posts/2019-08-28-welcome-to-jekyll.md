[Typing in the dark](https://typinginthedark.net/) starts with the need for a **free and accessible keyboard practicing tool**. Many of the existing solutions out there, are either too expensive, too boring to use, not accessible, or a combination of the three.

The lack of a good alternative is making it difficult. Especially for visually inpaired kids who are just starting out and learning how to navigate the keyboard.

We want to create a tool, that would help people to learn to type, without having to look at the keyboard, or the screen.

This tool will be based on audio feedback, and will feature lessons in for example, how to place your hands, and how to find specific keys.

The tool will be free, and open sourced under the MIT license. And we are looking forward to collaborate with the community on new features, fixing bugs, and improving the overall experience.
